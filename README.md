🔐 Multi-Layer Cryptographic Authentication System

![Secure Portal Preview](Registeration.jpeg)


A professional-grade secure portal built with Python and CustomTkinter. This project demonstrates a "Defense in Depth" strategy by using a 4-layer cryptographic pipeline to protect user credentials.

🛠 Features
4-Layer Security: Passwords undergo SHA-512 hashing, followed by DES, AES, and RSA encryption.

Modern UI: A sleek, dark-mode "Secure Portal" interface using CustomTkinter.

Real-time Strength Meter: Visual feedback on password complexity.

Self-Healing Setup: The system automatically generates required cryptographic keys and vault files upon the first run.
